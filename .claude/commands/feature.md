# /feature Command

Trigger: User types `/feature [description]`

## Your Task

Build a complete feature following the FULL SDLC.

## Process

Execute ALL phases from CLAUDE.md:

1. **CLARIFY** — Understand and classify (ALWAYS ask questions for CRITICAL/HIGH)
2. **DESIGN** — Document approach and security considerations
3. **IMPLEMENT** — Write production-quality code
4. **VERIFY** — Run security scans AND tests, auto-fix issues
5. **DELIVER** — Provide complete summary

## Quality Bar

This is a FEATURE, not a quick hack. Ensure:

- [ ] Clean, maintainable code structure
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Security scan passes
- [ ] Tests exist and pass
- [ ] Documentation/comments for complex logic

## Time Investment

Take your time. A feature deserves:
- Thoughtful design
- Complete implementation  
- Thorough verification

Don't rush. Don't skip steps.

## Start

Begin with Phase 1: CLARIFY

Restate the feature request and classify its security level.
